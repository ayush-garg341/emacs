* Links and images
Org mode supports links to files, URLs, and to other points in the org
file. In this example let's use an image from my website. First copy
it to the current directory. You can do this within emacs but for now
just run this command in your terminal.

curl http://www.star.bris.ac.uk/bjm/superman_cluster.gif -o superman_cluster.gif

To add a link to a file use C-u C-c C-l and type the name of a file.
Use tab-completion to select the image we just copied and you will
then be asked for a description - you can press enter to leave this
blank. This will create a link that looks like this

[[file:superman_cluster.gif]]

The links to my two previous org files one for making notes and other for handling tables:
[[file:notes.org][Link to making notes file]]
[[file:tables.org]]


If you do this in your org file, you wont see the [[ ]] above, instead
you'll see the text as a clickable link.

Since the file we have linked to is an image, we can tell emacs to open the
image in inline mode in the document using C-c C-x C-v and use the same command to
turn the image off again.

You can also click the link with the mouse, or use C-c C-o to follow
it, which might open your web browser, an image viewer or open a file
in emacs depending on the target of the link.

The structure of a link in org mode looks like this

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
[[link address][description]]
#+END_EXAMPLE

(I've enclosed the link in an example block which prevents org-mode
from trying to interpret as a real link, for the purpose of showing
its structure - we'll come back to blocks like this later.)

The link address is the URL or file name, and the description is the
text that is displayed, so we can replace our superman link with
something tidier like [[file:superman_cluster.gif][this]]

Links to web pages are easy - just put the http address in as the link
address. Use C-c C-l as a quick way to add such a link (remember we
used C-u C-c C-l is for adding a link to a file).

Two links to Link to youtube:
[[https://www.youtube.com/]]

[[https://www.youtube.com/][youtube link]]

Links to other parts of the org file are added easily like [[Links and
images][this link]]. Because the address part of the link matches a
headline in this document, then org-mode points the link to that part
of the file. Clicking it will move the cursor there.

Finally, we can add a caption and a name to our image like this

#+CAPTION: Superman and a galaxy cluster
#+NAME: fig.super
[[file:superman_cluster.gif]]

which means we can refer to our image later with a link like this one
[[fig.super]]


* Basic commands re-capture
1. C-u C-c C-l  => To add the link to a local file that exist on your system.
2. C-c C-x C-v  => To open the image in inline mode and same to turn it off
3. C-c C-l      => To add link to web pages
4. C-c C-o      => Click the link with the mouse, or use C-c C-o to follow it
