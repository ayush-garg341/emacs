;; car: content of address part in register, old terminology based on hardware
;; cdr: content of decrement part in register.

;; Incidentally, in the example, the list of flowers is quoted. If it were not, the Lisp interpreter would try to evaluate the list by calling rose as a function.

;; It is worth saying again that car and cdr are non-destructive.

;; The car and cdr functions are used for splitting lists and are considered fundamental to Lisp. Since they cannot split or gain access to the parts of an array, an array is considered an atom.

;; Conversely, the other fundamental function, cons, can put together or construct a list, but not an array.

;; Return a copy lacking all four elements.
(nthcdr 4 '(pine fir oak maple))

;;The nth function takes the car of the result returned by nthcdr. It returns the Nth element of the list. The nth function returns a single element of a list and is non-destructive.
(nth 0 '("one" "two" "three"))
(nth 1 '("one" "two" "three"))

;; The setcar and setcdr functions set the car or the cdr of a list to a new value. They actually change the original list, unlike car and cdr which leave the original list as it was.

(setq animals '(antelope giraffe lion tiger))
animals

(setcar animals 'hippopotamus)

;; So we can see that setcar did not add a new element to the list as cons would have; it replaced antelope with hippopotamus; it changed the list.

;; cutting and storing
;; When text is cut out of a buffer, it is stored on a list. The list that holds the pieces of text is called the kill ring.
;; The zap-to-char function removes the text in the region between the location of the cursor (i.e., of point) up to and including the next occurrence of a specified character. The text that zap-to-char removes is put in the kill ring; and it can be retrieved from the kill ring by typing C-y (yank).
;; If the command is given an argument, it removes text through that number of occurrences.

;; (interactive "p\ncZap to char: ")
;; "p\ncZap to char: " First, and most simply, is the ‘p’. The ‘p’ means that the first argument to the function will be passed the value of a processed prefix. The prefix argument is passed by typing C-u and a number, or M- and a number. The lower case ‘c’ indicates that interactive expects a prompt and that the argument will be a character.
