* What is virus?
That's a piece of malware that gets on a system that looks to be doing one thing, but it actually does something different.
It's lethal if it can propagate on its own. And here is the idea of WORM.
** What is WORM propagation or cascading?
- It includes 3 steps.
- Find a target (Another computer it can connect to, by TCP/IP address)
- Copy worm to target machine. (By exploiting bugs in a software, that allows to copy executables on another machine)
- Remote execution on target.

- First worm program in 1988, the Morris Worm.

* What is Trojan Horse?
- Something That looks like one thing but it's actually something different.
  - So imagine downloading something to mobile app (may be a game) not realising that the game may be sending out contacts to somebody.

** Now the question is how can we reduce the risk of trojan horse trapdoor ?
    - A. Testing the software
    - B. Code Review
    - C. Process Compliance
